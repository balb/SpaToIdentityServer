# SpaToIdentityServer
Demo ASP.NET Core Single Page App connecting to IdentityServer4

Shows how to hook up an ASP.NET Core React Single Page App to a separate instance of IdentityServer4.

Includes before and after folders - /before contains empty projects before any changes and /after contains all the changes 
for a basic working solution.

Demo code based on:

Identity Server - Adding a JavaScript client
https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstarts/4_javascript_client.html

Microsoft - Authentication and authorization for SPAs
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity-api-authorization?view=aspnetcore-3.1

## Notes
* API JWT auth uses access_tokens (not id_tokens!)
* Need to use ApiResources (not IdentityResources!) for API JWT auth in IdentityServer
* The AuthorizeService.js included here is a cut down version of the code generated by `dotnet new react -o <output_directory_name> -au Individual`
